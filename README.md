### Create four machine learning trading algorithm's using BTC csv data to generate returns try and outperform the cumulative daily returns. 
  Support Vector Classifier - Duke  
  
  Neural Network - Anna  
  
  Regression - Hardy  
  
Finish with plot comparing BTC daily returns vs trading strategy returns similar to what we did in Algorithmic Trading Module homework.

Technical Requirements:  

*  Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.
* Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.
* Create one or more machine learning models.
* Fit the model(s) to the training data.
* Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
* Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.
* Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.
* Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
